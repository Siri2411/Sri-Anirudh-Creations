                your print product.
                Any job order coming to the pre-press department is first checked for its quality and resolution and
                any errors are fixed at the stage itself.
                After processing, proofs are taken on a caliberated ink jet proofer and sent to the customers for
                approval. These inkjet proofs provide as close a match as possible with the printed press sheet.
                After receiving the approval the job is ready to print.
                Digital worklow of fully trapped and imposed files with color, bars,cut and fold marks which ensures
